# terraform-aws-tfstate-backend [![Codefresh Build Status](https://g.codefresh.io/api/badges/pipeline/cloudposse/terraform-modules%2Fterraform-aws-tfstate-backend?type=cf-1)](https://g.codefresh.io/public/accounts/cloudposse/pipelines/5d0d3d11c841e6807afe8d2a) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision an S3 bucket to store `terraform.tfstate` file and a DynamoDB table to lock the state file
to prevent concurrent modifications and state corruption.

The module supports the following:

1. Forced server-side encryption at rest for the S3 bucket
2. S3 bucket versioning to allow for Terraform state recovery in the case of accidental deletions and human errors
3. State locking and consistency checking via DynamoDB table to prevent concurrent operations
4. DynamoDB server-side encryption

https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html


__NOTE:__ The operators of the module (IAM Users) must have permissions to create S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables when performing `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`

__NOTE:__ This module cannot be used to apply changes to the `mfa_delete` feature of the bucket. Changes regarding mfa_delete can only be made manually using the root credentials with MFA of the AWS Account where the bucket resides. Please see: https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/62

[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend/releases).


1. Define the module in your `.tf` file using local state:
   ```hcl
    module "terraform_state_backend" {
      source        = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend.git?ref=master"
      namespace     = "eg"
      stage         = "test"
      name          = "terraform"
      attributes    = ["state"]
      region        = "us-east-1"
    }
   ```

1. `terraform init`

1. `terraform apply`. This will create the state bucket and locking table.

1. Then add a `backend` that uses the new bucket and table:
   ```hcl
    backend "s3" {
       region         = "us-east-1"
       bucket         = "< the name of the S3 bucket >"
       key            = "terraform.tfstate"
       dynamodb_table = "< the name of the DynamoDB table >"
       encrypt        = true
      }
    }

    module "another_module" {
      source = "....."
    }
   ```

1. `terraform init`. Terraform will detect that you're trying to move your state into S3 and ask, "Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?" Enter "yes". Now state is stored in the bucket and the DynamoDB table will be used to lock the state to prevent concurrent modifications.
