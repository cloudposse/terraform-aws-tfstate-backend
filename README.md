# terraform-aws-tfstate-backend [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision an S3 bucket to store `terraform.tfstate` file and a DynamoDB table to lock the state file 
to prevent concurrent modifications and state corruption.

The module supports the following:

1. Forced server-side encryption at rest for the S3 bucket
2. S3 bucket versioning to allow for Terraform state recovery in the case of accidental deletions and human errors
3. State locking and consistency checking via DynamoDB table to prevent concurrent operations
4. DynamoDB server-side encryption

https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html


__NOTE:__ The operators of the module (IAM Users) must have permissions to create S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables when performing `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`

## Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.11.3"
}

module "terraform_state_backend" {
  source        = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend.git?ref=master"
  namespace     = "cp"
  stage         = "prod"
  name          = "terraform"
  attributes    = ["state"]
  region        = "us-east-1"
}
```

__NOTE:__ First create the bucket and table without any state enabled (Terraform will use the local file system to store state).
You can then import the bucket and table by using [`terraform import`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html) and store the state file into the bucket.

Once the bucket and table have been created, configure the [backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html)

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.11.3"
  
  backend "s3" {
    region         = "us-east-1"
    bucket         = "< the name of the S3 bucket >"
    key            = "terraform.tfstate"
    dynamodb_table = "< the name of the DynamoDB table >"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}

module "another_module" {
  source = "....."
}
```

Initialize the backend with `terraform init`.

After `terraform apply`, `terraform.tfstate` file will be stored in the bucket, 
and the DynamoDB table will be used to lock the state to prevent concurrent modifications.
