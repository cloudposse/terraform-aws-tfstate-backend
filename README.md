Terraform module to provision an S3 bucket to store `terraform.tfstate` file and a DynamoDB table to lock the state file
to prevent concurrent modifications and state corruption.

The module supports the following:

1. Forced server-side encryption at rest for the S3 bucket
2. S3 bucket versioning to allow for Terraform state recovery in the case of accidental deletions and human errors
3. State locking and consistency checking via DynamoDB table to prevent concurrent operations
4. DynamoDB server-side encryption

https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html


__NOTE:__ The operators of the module (IAM Users) must have permissions to create S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables when performing `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`

__NOTE:__ This module cannot be used to apply changes to the `mfa_delete` feature of the bucket. Changes regarding mfa_delete can only be made manually using the root credentials with MFA of the AWS Account where the bucket resides. Please see: https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/629

## Usage


### Create

Follow this procedure just once to create your deployment.

1. Add the `terraform_state_backend` module to your `main.tf` file. The
   comment will help you remember to follow this procedure in the future:
   ```hcl
   # You cannot create a new backend by simply defining this and then
   # immediately proceeding to "terraform apply". The S3 backend must
   # be bootstrapped according to the simple yet essential procedure in
   # https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend#usage
   module "terraform_state_backend" {
     source = "cloudposse/tfstate-backend/aws"
     # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
     # version     = "x.x.x"
     namespace  = "eg"
     stage      = "test"
     name       = "terraform"
     attributes = ["state"]

     terraform_backend_config_file_path = "."
     terraform_backend_config_file_name = "backend.tf"
     force_destroy                      = false
   }

   # Your Terraform configuration
   module "another_module" {
     source = "....."
   }
   ```
   Module inputs `terraform_backend_config_file_path` and
   `terraform_backend_config_file_name` control the name of the backend
   definition file. Note that when `terraform_backend_config_file_path` is
   empty (the default), no file is created.

1. `terraform init`. This downloads Terraform modules and providers.

1. `terraform apply -auto-approve`. This creates the state bucket and DynamoDB locking
   table, along with anything else you have defined in your `*.tf` file(s). At
   this point, the Terraform state is still stored locally.

   Module `terraform_state_backend` also creates a new `backend.tf` file
   that defines the S3 state backend. For example:
   ```hcl
   backend "s3" {
     region         = "us-east-1"
     bucket         = "< the name of the S3 state bucket >"
     key            = "terraform.tfstate"
     dynamodb_table = "< the name of the DynamoDB locking table >"
     profile        = ""
     role_arn       = ""
     encrypt        = true
   }
   ```

   Henceforth, Terraform will also read this newly-created backend definition
   file.

1. `terraform init -force-copy`. Terraform detects that you want to move your
   Terraform state to the S3 backend, and it does so per `-auto-approve`. Now the
   state is stored in the S3 bucket, and the DynamoDB table will be used to lock
   the state to prevent concurrent modification.

This concludes the one-time preparation. Now you can extend and modify your
Terraform configuration as usual.

### Destroy

Follow this procedure to delete your deployment.

1. In `main.tf`, change the `terraform_state_backend` module arguments as
   follows:
   ```hcl
    module "terraform_state_backend" {
      # ...
      terraform_backend_config_file_path = ""
      force_destroy                      = true
    }
    ```
1. `terraform apply -target module.terraform_state_backend -auto-approve`.
   This implements the above modifications by deleting the `backend.tf` file
   and enabling deletion of the S3 state bucket.
1. `terraform init -force-copy`. Terraform detects that you want to move your
   Terraform state from the S3 backend to local files, and it does so per
   `-auto-approve`. Now the state is once again stored locally and the S3
   state bucket can be safely deleted.
1. `terraform destroy`. This deletes all resources in your deployment.
1. Examine local state file `terraform.tfstate` to verify that it contains
   no resources.

### Bucket Replication (Disaster Recovery)

To enable S3 bucket replication in this module, set `s3_replication_enabled` to `true` and populate `s3_replica_bucket_arn` with the ARN of an existing bucket.

```hcl
module "terraform_state_backend" {
  source = "cloudposse/tfstate-backend/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"
  namespace  = "eg"
  stage      = "test"
  name       = "terraform"
  attributes = ["state"]

  terraform_backend_config_file_path = "."
  terraform_backend_config_file_name = "backend.tf"
  force_destroy                      = false

  s3_replication_enabled = true
  s3_replica_bucket_arn  = "arn:aws:s3:::eg-test-terraform-tfstate-replica"
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
