# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision an S3 bucket to store `terraform.tfstate` file and a DynamoDB table to lock the state file
  to prevent concurrent modifications and state corruption.

  The module supports the following:

  1. Forced server-side encryption at rest for the S3 bucket
  2. S3 bucket versioning to allow for Terraform state recovery in the case of accidental deletions and human errors
  3. State locking and consistency checking via DynamoDB table to prevent concurrent operations
  4. DynamoDB server-side encryption

  https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html


  __NOTE:__ The operators of the module (IAM Users) must have permissions to create S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables when performing `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`

  __NOTE:__ This module cannot be used to apply changes to the `mfa_delete` feature of the bucket. Changes regarding mfa_delete can only be made manually using the root credentials with MFA of the AWS Account where the bucket resides. Please see: https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/62

# How to use this project
usage: |-

  ### Create

  Follow this procedure just once to create your deployment.

  1. Add the `terraform_state_backend` module to your `main.tf` file. The
     comment will help you remember to follow this procedure in the future:
     ```hcl
     # You cannot create a new backend by simply defining this and then
     # immediately proceeding to "terraform apply". The S3 backend must
     # be bootstrapped according to the simple yet essential procedure in
     # https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend#usage
     module "terraform_state_backend" {
       source = "cloudposse/tfstate-backend/aws"
       # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
       # version     = "x.x.x"
       namespace  = "eg"
       stage      = "test"
       name       = "terraform"
       attributes = ["state"]

       terraform_backend_config_file_path = "."
       terraform_backend_config_file_name = "backend.tf"
       force_destroy                      = false
     }

     # Your Terraform configuration
     module "another_module" {
       source = "....."
     }
     ```
     Module inputs `terraform_backend_config_file_path` and
     `terraform_backend_config_file_name` control the name of the backend
     definition file. Note that when `terraform_backend_config_file_path` is
     empty (the default), no file is created.

  1. `terraform init`. This downloads Terraform modules and providers.

  1. `terraform apply -auto-approve`. This creates the state bucket and DynamoDB locking
     table, along with anything else you have defined in your `*.tf` file(s). At
     this point, the Terraform state is still stored locally.

     Module `terraform_state_backend` also creates a new `backend.tf` file
     that defines the S3 state backend. For example:
     ```hcl
     backend "s3" {
       region         = "us-east-1"
       bucket         = "< the name of the S3 state bucket >"
       key            = "terraform.tfstate"
       dynamodb_table = "< the name of the DynamoDB locking table >"
       profile        = ""
       role_arn       = ""
       encrypt        = true
     }
     ```

     Henceforth, Terraform will also read this newly-created backend definition
     file.

  1. `terraform init -force-copy`. Terraform detects that you want to move your
     Terraform state to the S3 backend, and it does so per `-auto-approve`. Now the
     state is stored in the S3 bucket, and the DynamoDB table will be used to lock
     the state to prevent concurrent modification.

  This concludes the one-time preparation. Now you can extend and modify your
  Terraform configuration as usual.

  ### Destroy

  Follow this procedure to delete your deployment.

  1. In `main.tf`, change the `terraform_state_backend` module arguments as
     follows:
     ```hcl
      module "terraform_state_backend" {
        # ...
        terraform_backend_config_file_path = ""
        force_destroy                      = true
      }
      ```
  1. `terraform apply -target module.terraform_state_backend -auto-approve`.
     This implements the above modifications by deleting the `backend.tf` file
     and enabling deletion of the S3 state bucket.
  1. `terraform init -force-copy`. Terraform detects that you want to move your
     Terraform state from the S3 backend to local files, and it does so per
     `-auto-approve`. Now the state is once again stored locally and the S3
     state bucket can be safely deleted.
  1. `terraform destroy`. This deletes all resources in your deployment.
  1. Examine local state file `terraform.tfstate` to verify that it contains
     no resources.

  ### Bucket Replication (Disaster Recovery)

  To enable S3 bucket replication in this module, set `s3_replication_enabled` to `true` and populate `s3_replica_bucket_arn` with the ARN of an existing bucket.

  ```hcl
  module "terraform_state_backend" {
    source = "cloudposse/tfstate-backend/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"
    namespace  = "eg"
    stage      = "test"
    name       = "terraform"
    attributes = ["state"]

    terraform_backend_config_file_path = "."
    terraform_backend_config_file_name = "backend.tf"
    force_destroy                      = false

    s3_replication_enabled = true
    s3_replica_bucket_arn  = "arn:aws:s3:::eg-test-terraform-tfstate-replica"
  }
  ```
